# Precog Recruitment Task 2024

This repository contains all necessary documents and code for the Precog recruitment task 2024, focusing on Task 1 - Representations for words, phrases, and sentences. The repository is structured to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of the task components.

## Repository Structure

- `1.ipynb` - Contains Part A and the phrase similarity section of Part B.
- `2.ipynb` - Covers sentence similarity for Part B and Bonus Task 1.
- `3.ipynb` - Dedicated to similarity calculations using BERT embeddings (without fine-tuning).
- `datasets/` - Hosts SIMLEX999, AFINN111, and AFINN96 text files used in our analyses.
- `word_embedding_pics/` - Contains visual plots of word embeddings.
- `precog_report.pdf` - A comprehensive report detailing methodologies, results, and analyses, including a summary of the paper reading task.
- `paper_summary.pptx` - A PowerPoint presentation highlighting the strengths, weaknesses, and suggested improvements of the assigned reading.

## Overview

This project is divided into several Jupyter notebooks, each addressing different facets of word, phrase, and sentence representations. Markdown annotations within each notebook guide the reader through the methodologies and analytical processes.

## Data

The `datasets` directory includes essential resources:

- **SIMLEX999**: A dataset for semantic similarity evaluation.
- **AFINN111 and AFINN96**: Sentiment lexicons for sentiment analysis tasks.

## Visualizations

The `word_embedding_pics` directory provides graphical insights into the embedding space, illustrating the relationships between words.
